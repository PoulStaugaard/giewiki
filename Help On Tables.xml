}}}
CSS properties can be added to a table cell by preceding the cell content with CSS name/value pairs. There are two alternative forms of syntax:
{{{
|color:red; North West|opacity:0.5;North|North East|
|color(green):West|Here|East|
|South West|South|South East|
}}}

!Alternating Rows
giewiki automatically assigns the classes {{{oddRow}}} and {{{evenRow}}} to table rows {{{&lt;TR&gt;}}} elements. These can then be styled via the StyleSheet:
{{{
.viewer tr.oddRow { background-color: #fff; }
.viewer tr.evenRow { background-color: #ffc; }
}}}</pre>
