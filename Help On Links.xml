There are two ways to have giewiki generate links from your text content:
!Automatic links
In addition to the explicit link syntax described below, giewiki //automatically// generates links to the following resources:
|Resource|Pattern|h
|Tiddlers on the same page|..that are named using the WikiWord syntax|
|Pages in the same folder|..that are named using the WikiWord syntax|
|External URL's|..that start with either of the protocol specifiers {{{file, http, https, mailto, ftp, irc, news, data}}} &lt;br&gt;followed by the usual {{{://url-name}}} pattern, as in https://giewiki.appspot.com|
To ''//avoid//'' automatic link generation from words that follow WikiWord syntax, prefix it with a '~' (&quot;tidle&quot;) character.
!Explicit link syntax
To create a &quot;pretty&quot; link to various resources, use the patterns:
|Resource|Pattern|h
|Tiddlers on the same page|{{{[[tiddler name]]}}}|
|A separate page on the site|{{{[[Link text|/path-to-page]]}}}|
|A specific tiddlers elsewhere on this site|{{{[[Link text|/path-to-page#tiddler]]}}}|
|Any resource|{{{[[Link text|Fully specified URL]]}}}|

		<pre>A WikiWord is a word composed of two or more words slammed together with each of their first letters capitalised. WikiWord notation in a conventional WikiWikiWeb is used to name individual pages while TiddlyWiki uses WikiWord titles for smaller chunks of MicroContent. Referring to a page with a WikiWord automatically creates a link to it. Clicking on a link jumps to that page or, if it doesn't exist, to an editor to create it. It's also easy to have NonWikiWordLinks, and there's a WikiWordEscape for situations where you don't want a WikiWord to be interpreted as a link.</pre>
