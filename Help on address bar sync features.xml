		<pre>There are two ways to sync the browser address bar with the the content displayed in the middle (aka. //"Story"//) column:
|!Automatic|!On demand|
|When the checkbox labeled permaview (//in the right sidebar options panel//) is checked, the address bar will be updated whenever the contents of story column changes. This mimics a behaviour that you may be familiar with on other sites and allows you to hit 'refresh' ''at any time'' to get potentially new versions of the content you are seeing.|Experienced users may prefer to disable the automatic updates of the address bar, in which case they can still have it happen by clicking ''permaview'' (//in the right sidebar options panel//).|
Background: The term ''permaview'' originates from [[TiddlyWiki|http://tiddlywiki.com]], meaning a permanent representation of the specific content you have in view, one that you can copy from the address bar for later reference.
