Any ''.js'' files that you place in this folder and add to the list defined in the file ''javascripts.py'', will be presented when you click ''external scripts''. Any scripts that you select will be loaded as part of the ''config.js'' script. The scripts that are available 'out of the box' are:
* [[jQuery|http://jquery.com]] (minified version) - a general purpose library that you've probably heard of.
* [[Modernizr|http://www.modernizr.com/]] (2.0.6 development version) - Modernizr adds classes to the &lt;html&gt; element which allow you to target specific browser functionality in your stylesheet. You don't actually need to write any Javascript to use it. Modernizr is a small and simple JavaScript library that helps you take advantage of emerging web technologies (CSS3, HTML 5) while still maintaining a fine level of control over older browsers that may not yet support these new technologies. If load time is paramount, consider creating a minified version with just the stuff you need at the http://www.modernizr.com/download/ page.
